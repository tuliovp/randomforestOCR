                    Big data analytics (BDA) is no longer a competitive advantage, but a compulsory ability to endure in an ecosystem increasingly attentive to customer behaviour. In this context, few industries offer such an abundance of raw customer data as e-commerce, where is possible to explore why users make many decisions and judgments. One of most commonly used feature in e-commerce is the online customer review rating (OCR), a form of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) that can reduce the unfamiliarity risk in purchase decision, and also seen as an essential index of overall customer satisfaction. Although the idea of OCRs as a sales driver being well researched, little is discussed about the factors coming from the side of the seller that drive the OCRs themselves. This research, as an alternative, uses OCR as the predicted variable, testing if the different ways the product and order were placed may impact on final consumer satisfaction (measured by the OCR). To investigate this relationship, the research conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of order attributes (such as delivery time, description length and price) contained in a data set of 100,000 transactions made through a Brazilian marketplace called Olist. Next, the research uses the attributes to predict the OCR through Linear and Ordinal Logistic regressions, as well as through Random Forest regression and classification models. The Random Forest classifier, in particular, produces a very reliable prediction, with an accuracy of 1.00 for OCRs rated as 1, 4 and 5, and an accuracy of 0.99 for OCRs rated as 2 and 3. The attribute weights and correlations are somewhat validated, and the outcomes may contribute to future work of scholars and entrepreneurs in the field of consumer behaviour, product management, and data analysis.

                    <p>The research tries to understand if the product category or the order organisation and execution might have an influence on customer satisfaction by creating some expectations, that will be fulfilled or not. Being a very general investigation, it is further subdivided into six hypotheses to facilitate the experiment according to the different attributes collected — from how the product is displayed up to when it is delivered. Then, a model is developed for predicting which score (OCR) the consumer would give according to the information from these attributes. Therefore, the research question is:

                    <b>“Does particular product characteristics and order structures impact on the final customer satisfaction (measured by the OCR)?”</b>

                    Research hypotheses:
                    <ul>
                      <li>H1: Product categories have biases towards the online customer review rating (OCR)</li>
                      <li>H2: An increase in the product price negatively impacts the online customer review rating (OCR)</li>
                      <li>H3: An increase in the delivery price negatively impacts the online customer review rating (OCR)</li>
                      <li>H4: An increase in the delivery time negatively impacts the online customer review rating (OCR)</li>
                      <li>H5: An increase in the description size positively impacts the online customer review rating (OCR)</li>
                      <li>H6: An increase in the number of photos positively impacts the online customer review rating (OCR)</li>
                    </ul>
